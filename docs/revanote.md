# Revanote Integration

> Phase 08 — Inbound visual annotations from Revanote → routed as `user_message` into the appropriate Claude session → outbound callback with the resolution.

## Overview

[Revanote](https://app.revanote.com) is a UI visual-commenting tool. A reviewer leaves an annotation on a deployed page (a comment pinned to a DOM element, with a screenshot, deep-link, and optional thread). Revanote POSTs that annotation to remo-code's hub. The hub:

1. Authenticates the webhook (URL-token + optional HMAC).
2. Resolves the page host to a repo (via user-configured `revanote_app_mappings`).
3. Finds the Claude session bound to that repo's `project_dir`.
4. Sends the annotation as a `user_message` (with a `[revanote: <preview>]` storage prefix so it surfaces with a violet **Annotation** pill in the chat UI).
5. Waits for the agent reply, parses a structured `<<JSON>>{…}<<END>>` envelope.
6. POSTs a callback to Revanote with `{ resolved, action_taken, agent_reply, files_changed, deployed, error? }` — with exponential retry on 5xx/network errors.

## Auth & secret

A single per-user UUID (`users.revanote_webhook_secret`) does triple duty:

- URL-path token on the inbound webhook (`POST /api/revanote/webhook/<user_id>/<token>`).
- HMAC signing key for `X-Revuu-Signature: sha256=<hex>` (when Revanote signs the body — verified when the header is present).
- Bearer credential on outbound callbacks (`Authorization: Bearer <secret>`).

**Rotate** via `POST /api/account/revanote-webhook-secret/rotate` — returns `{ user_id, token, webhook_secret, webhook_url, auth_mode }` in one call, replacing both directions atomically.

## Endpoints

### Public (no auth catch-all)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| ------ | ---- | ------- |
| `POST` | `/api/revanote/webhook/:user_id/:token` | Inbound annotation. Returns `202 { accepted, annotation_id, annotation_id_external }` or `400` / `401`. |

### JWT-authed (license-gated)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| ------ | ---- | ------- |
| `GET`    | `/api/account/revanote-webhook-secret`        | Status + full webhook URL (treat the URL as a secret). |
| `POST`   | `/api/account/revanote-webhook-secret/rotate` | Mint a new secret + URL. |
| `GET`    | `/api/account/revanote-webhook-attempts?limit=10` | Recent webhook hits (success + auth_failed + hmac_failed). |
| `PUT`    | `/api/account/revanote-budget-pct`            | Per-source budget split. `{ budget_pct: 1..100 \| null }`. Default 60. |
| `GET`    | `/api/revanote/mappings`                      | List repo mappings. |
| `POST`   | `/api/revanote/mappings`                      | Create. Body: `{ hostname_pattern, repo_path, supervisor_id?, deploy_strategy?, auto_merge?, enabled? }`. |
| `PATCH`  | `/api/revanote/mappings/:id`                  | Partial update. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/revanote/mappings/:id`                  | Remove. |
| `GET`    | `/api/revanote/mappings/resolve?host=…`       | Debug: best-match mapping for a host. |
| `GET`    | `/api/revanote/annotations`                   | List annotations. `?status=&limit=`. |
| `GET`    | `/api/revanote/annotations/:id`               | Annotation + run history. |
| `POST`   | `/api/revanote/annotations/:id/retry`         | Reset to `pending` + re-dispatch. |

## Inbound payload

```jsonc
{
  "source": "revanote",
  "revanote_version": "1.0.0",
  "annotation_id": "<revanote's own id>",
  "annotation_url": "https://app.revanote.com/review/<project_id>#annotation-<id>",
  "page_url": "https://app.example.com/dashboard",
  "screenshot_url": "https://cdn.revanote.com/shots/abc.png",
  "x": 120, "y": 240,
  "element_selector": "button.cta",
  "element_meta": { /* opaque — preserved on annotations.payload_raw */ },
  "capture_viewport": { /* opaque — preserved on annotations.payload_raw */ },
  "comment": "the button is the wrong color",
  "comment_preview": "the button is the wrong colo…",
  "replies": [{ "author": "jay", "text": "really wrong", "ts": "…" }],
  "callback_url": "https://app.revanote.com/api/agent-callbacks",
  "timestamp": 1716800000   /* optional; enforced as 5-min skew when present */
}
```

`element_meta` and `capture_viewport` are passed through to the agent prompt without schema columns — they live in `annotations.payload_raw` so future Revanote-side additions never break the contract.

## Repo→app mappings

Each user defines mappings under Settings → Revanote:

| Field | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `hostname_pattern` | Literal (`app.example.com`) or leading-glob (`*.example.com`) or `*`. Most-specific match wins; ties broken by most-recently-updated. |
| `repo_path` | Absolute path on the agent host. Hub uses `findSessionByProjectDir(userId, repo_path)` to resolve the bound Claude session. |
| `supervisor_id` | Optional pin to a specific supervisor. |
| `deploy_strategy` | `pr` (default), `direct`, or `none`. Controls the in-prompt instructions to Claude — the hub itself does NOT shell out. |
| `auto_merge` | Only meaningful with `pr` strategy. |
| `enabled` | Disable a mapping without deleting it. |
| `auto_created` | `true` when the smart-fallback path inserted the row from a supervisor-reported repo host match (user must touch the row in Settings to confirm). |

## Agent prompt envelope

The hub renders a Markdown prompt and instructs Claude to end the reply with:

```
<<JSON>>
{
  "resolved": true,
  "action_taken": "short summary",
  "files_changed": ["a.tsx", "b.ts"],
  "deployed": true,
  "needs_clarification": false
}
<<END>>
```

The hub-side parser (`hub/src/revanote/result-schema.ts`) tolerates:

1. The envelope (preferred).
2. A ```` ```json ```` fenced block (fallback).
3. Bare prose (last resort — synthesizes `{ resolved: false, action_taken: "parse_failed", agent_reply: <raw> }`).

The web `MessageBubble` strips the envelope (and stray ```` ```json ```` fences) from the displayed assistant text via `stripRevanoteEnvelope` so the user only sees natural language.

## Outbound callback

```http
POST <callback_url>
Authorization: Bearer <revanote_webhook_secret>
X-Revanote-Webhook-Source: remo-code
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "annotation_id": "<external annotation_id>",
  "resolved": true,
  "action_taken": "Updated tailwind class to fix alignment",
  "agent_reply": "Found it — the flex-direction was reversed…",
  "files_changed": ["web/src/components/MessageBubble.tsx"],
  "deployed": true,
  "needs_clarification": false,
  "clarification_question": null,
  "error": null
}
```

**Retry curve (jittered ±10%):** `1m → 5m → 15m → 1h → 4h → 12h → dead-letter`. 4xx responses are terminal; 5xx and network errors retry. Each attempt writes a row to `revanote_callback_attempts`; a single worker (30 s tick, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` claim) drives delivery.

**`deployed: true` means the agent pushed to the deploy branch — NOT that Coolify finished building and is serving traffic.** Polling deploy-status is deferred to a follow-up phase.

## Pre-dispatch rejection callbacks

The callback is also fired (immediately, with `resolved: false` + an `error` tag) for these pre-dispatch outcomes:

| `error` tag | Meaning |
| ----------- | ------- |
| `budget_threshold` | Claude usage threshold or per-source revanote budget exceeded. |
| `no_target` | No mapping matches the page_url host, or no Claude session bound to the resolved `repo_path`. |
| `session_busy` | The bound session already has the max in-flight + 1 waiter for this concern. |

Session-offline is the exception: it parks in the 10-min grace buffer instead of firing an immediate failure callback.

## Cost cap, thresholds, concurrency

- All dispatches flow through `enforceCostCap` (`hub/src/scheduler/dispatcher.ts`).
- A per-source split (`users.revanote_budget_pct`, default 60% of daily cap) prevents annotation storms from starving scheduled tasks.
- Quota threshold (Claude usage caps) gates dispatch the same way as scheduled tasks.
- The per-session queue from `hub/src/scheduler/session-queue.ts` keeps at most 1 in-flight + 1 waiter per session. Concurrent annotations against the same repo serialize through it.

## WS events

Lifecycle events broadcast to all clients of the user (use `subscribe` from `useWebSocket`):

- `revanote_received` — webhook accepted, row inserted.
- `revanote_dispatched` — `user_message` sent to Claude.
- `revanote_skipped` — pre-dispatch gate refused (offline / busy / cap / threshold).
- `revanote_resolved` — agent finished. Includes `resolved`, `files_changed`, `deployed`.
- `revanote_callback_sent` — one callback attempt finished. `delivered: true` is terminal success; `dead: true` is terminal failure.

## Tables (additive — all `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`)

| Table | Purpose |
| ----- | ------- |
| `users.revanote_webhook_secret` | Single UUID — URL token + HMAC key + outbound Bearer. |
| `users.revanote_budget_pct` | Per-source daily-cap fraction (1..100, default 60). |
| `revanote_app_mappings` | Hostname pattern → repo_path + deploy strategy. |
| `annotations` | Durable record of every inbound annotation. UNIQUE `(user_id, annotation_id_external)`. |
| `annotation_runs` | One row per Claude turn that processed an annotation. |
| `revanote_callback_attempts` | Retry queue. `next_retry_at IS NULL` = terminal (delivered or dead). |
| `revanote_webhook_attempts` | Audit log (capped 100/user). |

## Cross-side contract notes

See `.planning/phases/08-revanote-integration/08-CONTEXT.md` "Confirmed cross-side contract". Briefly:

- Revanote sets `source: 'revanote'`, `revanote_version`, `annotation_url`.
- Hub uses `annotation_url` as the violet pill's href when present; falls back to plain text when absent.
- The rotate endpoint returns BOTH the new URL slug AND the bearer secret in one call.
- The callback always includes `annotation_id` (the external one), even on pre-dispatch rejections.
- Comment preview is sliced locally via `Intl.Segmenter` (`renderAnnotationPrompt` / `previewComment`). If Revanote pre-slices `comment_preview` we use it; otherwise we slice from `comment` (first 30 grapheme clusters).

## Out of scope (deferred)

- Coolify deploy-status poll → enriched callback with `live_at`.
- Slack/Discord ping on `resolved: false`.
- Per-mapping prompt-template override.
- Cross-annotation batching (multiple annotations on the same page within 1 h merged into one Claude turn).
- Two-way replies (agent → user → agent loop in the Revanote thread).
